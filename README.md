# Advill.github.io
Personal site for resume and projects.

## Running
Runs on gitub.io so no server, everything is static. Can be pulled down to a
local machine and will work the same. Nothing to run, simply open `index.html`
in your browser. 
 
## Tools Used
The only external resource I make heavy use of is 
[bootswatch's Lux template css](https://bootswatch.com/lux).

## Current state
Things are close to finished, I still need to set up a custom domain for the
site, as linking directly to the github io, while not actually bad, seems to be
the worse solution. I'm going to wait until I am closer to actually showing this
site to people to actually do that though.
