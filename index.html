      I'm Mike, A CS major at JMU. I love coding and am always excited to learn
      new languages, tools, and libraries. I am looking for internships that
      will challenge me to experiment with new and exciting tools to find
      solutions.
    </p>
    <p>
      I've moved around most of my life as my dad was in the army for 22 years,
      but would call virginia my hometown, as I've lived here for the longest
      (13 years!).
    </p>
    <p>
      I went to South County High School, where I took mainly art
      classes and Spanish for my electives. I was, and still am, very interested
      in computer graphics, photography and drawing. My last year I took AP
      computer science and fell in love. I had known I liked computers, and had
      the slightest bit of coding experience from hanging out on code/game
      forums as a kid, but knew after I took that class that coding was my
      career.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nowadays, my main art form is guitar, and I've recently started taking
      lessons again. I don't know that I'd call myself a pro or anything but it
      is fun to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      While I wouldn't say that I have a specific 'perfect job' that I'm looking
      for yet, I am trying to get as much experience as I can before I get out
      of college.

          Veri-safe was the intern hack-a-thon project done at SWIFT. I worked
          with other interns to try to solve a problem facing the company. As
          SWIFT is a very security-focused company, we decided to use the
          OpenALPR library to scan incoming vehicle license plates to determine
          if they were SWIFT employees or unknown vehicles.
        </p>
        <p class="card-text">
          The main part of this project that I wored on was the Node interface
          with the ALPR library, as well as the 'front-half' of the backend
          server.

        <p class="card-text">
          PCDB is SWIFT's automation of ansible setup scripts for specific
          applications and machines. Because of the wide variety of requirements
          for applications SWIFT is developing, we wanted to give users the
          ability to dictate how a system is configured so they can focus on
          development.
        </p>
        <p class="card-text">
          The PCDB system was only in the beginning stages of development during
          my time at SWIFT, but the idea behind it was very cool to me. The
          goal was to have the user input a Yaml file to the program, have
          internal json-schema validation to ensure that the user has included
          all variables that are needed, and finally spin up a VM and run
          ansible playbooks to set up requested programs.

          Y86 is a fake processer that we emulated for our Computer
          Systems class. The project was intended to show the inner workings of
          a real processor by creating a stripped-down version and showing every
          step of the process. The Y86 Emulator could take .y86 program files,
          extract information including the headers, program headers, as well as
          any code or data stored within, converted to human-readable format.
